# Battleship_Simulator
Simulator for the game of battleship

This project is a simulator for the game of battleship.  It is a one-player version of the game where a computer algorithm attempts to beat the game in as few moves as possible by sinking all of the ships which have been placed randomly on the game board.  The purpose of this simulation is to test different strategies for playing the game of battleship.  The main goal is to develop an alogorithm that will sink all of the ships in as few moves as possible.  This simulator makes it possible to run thousands of instances of one-player battleship games to test the strength of different strategies as played by the computer algorithm.

This project is written completely in Python and employs object oriented programming.  I have also developed numerous tests to test the algorithms ability to play intuitively in common situacions and also in edge cases.  The algorithm has two modes: at first it uses random attacks to locate an enemy ship. Then it uses a ship killing algorithm once a ship is found.  This ship killing algorithm takes into account the remaining ships on the board and the probability distribution for each remaining ship before every move it makes.  Once all found ships are sunk it returns to making random attacks.

I am also adding images of probability distributions that I generated using this simulator for the aircraft carrier.  These are the "PNG" files in the project folder.  The aircraft carrier is 5 units long.  The probability distribution represents the likely hood of finding the ship on any given square of the game board.  On an open board, ships are less likely to be found in the corners and more likely to be found in the center of the board.  The probability distribution can actually be calculated.  As the number of simulations I run to approximate the distribution increases the closer it gets to the correct answer.
